# uiuc_wallet_app
The following class project for CS340 (Intro to Computer Systems) is a wallet simulator. It uses thread-safe resource allocation with blocking and non-blocking transaction capabilities; this logic can be found in wallet.py. Meanwhile, wallet-server.py implements a socket-based server that handles multiple concurrent client connections using Pythonâ€™s socket module. The idea behind this project is that when ran with tester code, many "transactions" (threads) are ran concurrently on the wallet server, adding and decreasing balances of different values, like dollars, cents, yen, emojis, etc. The thread-safe resource allocation functions prevent "impossible" wallet transactions from occuring; if you start with a balance of $0, deposit $5 and withdraw $10, the "withdraw $10" transaction is prevented (blocked) until the balance is sufficent enough to withdraw $10.
